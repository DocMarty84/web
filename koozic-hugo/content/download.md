# Mobile applications

Any Subsonic compatible application should be compatible with KooZic from v0.3.0. Numerous links are
provided on the [official website](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp). However, many of these
applications are not supported anymore. Here is a selection of applications that were tested
extensively with KooZic.

### Android

-   [DSub](https://github.com/daneren2005/Subsonic/releases): probably the best choice, actively
    developed. You should definitively have a look at its numerous features!
-   [UltraSonic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.moire.ultrasonic): a very good
    choice, although less fancy features than DSub. Anyway, perfectly suitable for a daily use.
-   [Subsonic Music Streamer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sourceforge.subsonic.androidapp):
    the official client. More a proof-of-concept than an application that you would use on a daily
    basis.

### iOS

On iOS, three applications were also tested. Once again, the compatibility with KooZic is very good.

-   [Soundwaves](https://itunes.apple.com/app/soundwaves/id736139596?mt=8): a free app! It focuses
    on music streaming and leaves aside the fancy stuff. Anyway, it does it pretty well.
-   [play:Sub](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/play-sub-subsonic-music-streamer/id955329386?mt=8):
    probably the best paid app, although the development seems to be on stall.
-   [AVSub](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/avsub/id923424694?mt=8): a lot of features, although not
    really in line with the iOS design.
